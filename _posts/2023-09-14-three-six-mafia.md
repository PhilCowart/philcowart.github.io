Most guys my age have "the chat". The one with your college buddies that doesn't have any reason to exist but sharing memes, arguing about something pointless, poking fun of each other, and updating everyone on big life events. I am like most guys.

Recently the discussion switched to the Three 6 Rule. The idea that a guy needs to meet or surpass a measurement of six in three categories:

- 6 figure income
- 6 feet tall
- 6 inch pecker

Well off the bat, I'm pretty far from 6 feet. You can make any other assumptions you wish. However, I am happily married to a pretty cool lady. What's the deal? Did my wife not know about the rule? Or is it possible that I could compensate for poor performance in one category by being exceptional in another? If so, by how much?

These are questions. Important questions. Questions that *demand* an answer.

### The Approach

Where I live (USA), being 6 foot tall or greater is somewhat rare. Distribution of height is like bell-curve 101. As you can see below, a height of 6 feet is right at the 90th percentile. 10% of men are 6 feet tall or taller. Let's use that as our approach. Being 6 feet tall puts you in the top 10% of all males.

Now what about pecker size? Fortunately, this also follows a pretty standard bell curve. 6 inches is actually even less common than 6 feet.
