<br/>

Most guys my age have "the chat". The one with your college buddies that doesn't have any reason to exist but sharing memes, arguing about something pointless, poking fun of each other, and updating everyone on big life events. I am like most guys.

Recently the discussion switched to the Three 6 Rule. The idea that a guy needs to meet or surpass a measurement of six in three categories:

- 6 figure income
- 6 feet tall
- 6 inch pecker

Well off the bat, I'm pretty far from 6 feet. You can make any other assumptions you wish. However, I'm happily married to a pretty rad smokeshow. What's the deal? Was my wife ignorant of the rule? Or is it possible to compensate for poor performance in one area with exceptionality in another? If so, what is the conversion rate and is there an opportunity for arbitrage?

These are important questions. Questions that *demand* an answer.  

### The Approach

The first time you ever sat in a stats class you probably talked about the heights of third-grade boys, and someone drew a pretty bell curve. Distribution of heights is like bell curve 101, and bell curves are incredibly useful. With just two numbers, a mean and std deviation, you can describe an entire population and run all types of analysis against it.

Where I live (USA), being 6 feet tall or greater is somewhat rare. 91% of all men are below this height. However, older people tend to shrink with age and are much less likely to be in the dating pool. Especially the dating pool of someone following the Three 6 Rule. So let's only look at American Males between the ages of 20 and 30. 

<img />

As you can see above, a height of 6 feet is roughly at the 75th percentile. 75th percentile!? Yawn. We're not talking about SAT scores, we're eliminating men from the dating pool based on three silly numbers. We're looking for the cream of the crop of American men. Percentile is way too boring of a term. Let's call this the "Exclusivity Score".

Much better. By eliminating guys under 6 feet we've removed 75% of the population from the dating pool. We're left with the top 25%, the 0.25 most exclusive men. The kind of men that people think "Wow, you're dating him?!" In a room full of 100 guys, you've narrowed down your choices to just 25 men from the start.


Now what about pecker size? Fortunately, this also follows a pretty standard bell curve. 6 inches is actually much less common than 6 feet. The average erect penis length is 5.166" with a standard deviation of 0.654". A 6 inch pecker puts you right at the 90th percentile for an Exclusivity Score of 10%.

<img /> 

To use the same scenario above, you've narrowed those 100 fellas down to just 5 choices! Of course, maybe the weirdest part is standing in a room with 100 men publicly and accurately broadcasting the size of their weiner, but we'll ignore this little fact. I'm hoping you can see that a follower of the Three 6 rule has pretty high standards. 


### Getting Too Big for Our Britches

Here is where we start doing something dumb. I've got a room of 100 potential dating partners. 10 of these men meet the height criteria and 6 of them meet the pecker critera. What are the odds that somebody is in both groups?

To combine the odds of two independent actions together all you have to do is multiply them. The odds of rolling a 5 with a die is 1 in 6. The odds of doing it a second time are also 1 in 6. The odds of rolling 5 two times in a row is:

	1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 = 2.778%

What if the actions aren't independent? If I take a deck of cards and draw one randomly, there is a 1 in 2 chance it is red. If I keep that card, what are the odds that the next card I draw is also red? It's not 1 in 2. The deck now has 51 cards, 26 of which are black and 25 of which are red. On my second turn, the odds of drawing a red card are 25 in 51. Just slightly worse than 50/50. The odds of the second action are *dependent* upon the first actions.

The odds of drawing two red cards in a row are:

	1/2 * 25/51 = 25/102 = 24.51%


Height and pecker size seem to be correlated, but there isn't a lot of great data out there. Generally a taller person will have a longer pecker. Since we can't model this relationship with high confidence, and because this exercise is *incredibly* low stakes, we're going to ignore it. In reality, someone who meets or exceeds the height criteria is more likely than the general population to meet the pecker critera. However, we're going to treat these odds as two independent events like rolling the same die twice.


So back to these two groups of 25 and 10 guys. If we treat these as independent events and multiply their odds we can come up with a **Blended Exclusivity Score**.

	1/4 * 1/10 = 1/40 = 2.5%


Now we're talking! The Three 6 rule is really starting to shine in it's ability to enforce excusivity. In a room full of 100 random guys you may find two or three that can meet our criteria so far.


### Let's Talk About Money

Humans have gotten bigger over time. Napolean wasn't short at 5'6", he was actually a bit on the tall side for French men in the 19th Century. However, no one has ever included height or pecker size in any CPI basket-of-goods when talking about inflation. Neither party's economic policy is to blame for the rising cost of peckers in the grocery store. The height of American men isn't driven by interest rates. Incomes are.

So when we talk about a 6 figure income, we need to nail down a date. When I was a wee lad in 1990 you couldn't buy a Coca Cola for a nickel, but you could buy an RC Cola for a quarter.

Inflation is insidious because it compounds. It doesn't grow linearly, but exponentially. Average annual inflation between 1960 and 2022 was 3.8%[^1]. To calculate the buying pwoer of a 1960 dollar in 2022:

	$1 * (1 + 3.8%)^(2022 - 1960) = $10.10

50 years ago, finding someone with a 6 figure salary was as rare as a pregnant nun. 50 years from now it will be more common than _____. For now we'll look at 2020 since that is the most recent set of good data.

The other trouble with distribution of incomes is that they don't follow a bell curve. Since I'm dumb[^2], this is going to test our model when we start looking at compensation.  An income of $100,000 puts you at the 84th percentile for an Exclusivity Score of 17%.



### Setting a Baseline

We already talked about the odds of finding someone in a group of 100 guys that are both 6 feet tall and have a 6 inch pecker. If we add in their salary we can get our final Blended Exclusivity Score.

	1/4 * 1/10 * 17/100 = 17/4,000 = 0.425%

In that same group of guys, it's actually unlikely that a single one will meet all three criteria. Perfection, we now have a a truly unreasonable set of standards by which to choose our dating partner.

Furthermore, we now have a standard by which we measure other permutations of height, pecker length, and income. As long as we remain more exclusive than 0.425% of the population we can explore variations of these data points and start to answer the big questions of life:

- Can you still date someone that is 5'3" if their income is $200k+?
- How tall does someone need to be to compensate for a micro-penis?
- Is there a pecker length at which height & income don't matter?
